## **The Player Prefab Zone 🧍‍♂️🔧**  

1. Navigate to `Assets/Resources/PhotonButDoneForYou`.  
2. Open the **Player Visual Prefab** and get customizing:  
   - Adjust rotation offsets.  
   - Swap out the player model. Make it a dragon, robot, or even a dancing banana. Go wild.  

**Pro Tip:**  
If your player model acts like a diva and won’t sync across platforms, enable:  
`Sync Rig Using RPC`.

## **Final Adjustments 🛠️**  

- Is your username clipping through your VR headset?  
  Fix it by tweaking the **Text Vertical Offset** in the Player Visual Prefab.

## **EZ API & Tips (PhotonManager Edition)** 📚💡  

### **Meet the Singleton:**  
The **PhotonManager** class has a singleton called `instance`—because we know you love shortcuts.

   - Easy-peasy function to connect to a lobby.

   - Sets your username. *(Be nice, no weird names.)*  

3. **`Disconnect()` v1.0+**  
   - Logs you out of the lobby. (Don’t rage quit. It’s not cool.)  

4. **`DestroyPlayerVisual()` v1.0+**  
   - Poof! Makes your player visual disappear. Perfect for when you want to be stealthy or just invisible.  

5. **`SpawnPlayerVisual()` v1.0+**  
   - Brings your player visual back. (Because, obviously, you’re the star of the show.)  

6. **`KickPlayer(Player player)` v1.1+**
   - Forcfully kicks a player out of the room. (But don't get too mad at sombody!)

7. **`BanPlayer(Player player)` v1.1+**
   - Kicks the player and blocks them from joining that instance again.
